<!--the "a href" tag creates a link. In this case, I gave each project its own link so
that it will take you to that particular project on this page. See below where the "id"

    <p><h3>PROJECT #1</h3></br> Love and Regards is a poem based off of a text I had sent to my partner. The original text read as "omw to class rn will get to ur messages later todayyyy i hope ur day goes good!" 
    It was really interesting seeing the variety in my results from the first page. I ended up focusing on the "I hope your day goes good!" aspect and divided the concept from a positive light
    to a negative light. From my perspective, texting gives people only one point of view and limits physical human interaction. Sometimes you don't know someones true intention behind their words.
    I also took it in the way that I used to overthink texting others.

    <p><h3>PROJECT #2</h3></br> For my green screen project, I decided to do my own take of the POV videos. This POV is based on the viewer being a girl sitting alone at a Mexican dance (a Baile). 
    Suddenly another girl who is also sitting out the Nortenas sparks a conversation. It relates to my personal experiences at bailes since I'm not a fan of this particular style of dance and I've met other people similar to the person I'm acting as.
    You are then taken out to dance once El Payaso de Rodeo (a popular line dance) comes on (this one is my personal favorite). 
    I wanted to use a party based background for the green screen since it's common to have strobe lights and a dark atmosphere at these events.
    The songs I used are Te Vas a Acordar de Mi by La Fiera de Ojinaga and Payaso de Rodeo by Caballo Dorado. This was really fun to do since it
    blends my personal experiences at dances and my love for acting into one.

    <p><h3>PROJECT #3</h3></br> For my twine game RAGE, I decided to make it into a first person point of view Zombie Apocolypse based game. The genres it would fall under would be horror, survival, and suspense. 
    You wake up in a basement as a young 15-year-old Mexican girl who just had her Quince since the apocolypse started. There are two offical endings but the two choices have alternate endings.
    As you progress, you have to make the choices to defend yourself or attack others. The farther you go, the harder it is to turn back. 
    I also wanted to add the illusion of control in this concept, so while the two journeys are different, the overall theme is consistent since it's in a world deprived of normalcy.
    Parts of my inspiration for this game came by music from Rob Zombie, Mortician, Radiohead, Nirvana, and Depeche Mode. Other zombie based media such as The Walking Dead,
    Train to Busan, All of Us Are Dead, and World War Z have inspired me to write my own zombie based game. </p>
